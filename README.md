# MB_Granuloma
Granulomas are the hallmark of mycobacterial (MB) infections, forming structured immune environments that contain the bacteria but also drive disease persistence. However, their spatial and functional organization remains unclear. Using spatial RNA sequencing on 39 patient samples, we identified five distinct granuloma niches: a necrotic core, an immune-activated inner niche, an inflammatory and an extracellular matrix (ECM)-remodeling middle niche, an outer structural niche, and a tertiary lymphoid structure niche supporting antigen presentation. Immune activity peaks in the inner niche, transitioning to fibrosis at the periphery. Lymph node granulomas display reduced fibroblast involvement but stronger JAK-STAT activation. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) granulomas exhibit heightened JAK-STAT and IFN-Î³ signaling, while non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) granulomas show increased hypoxia signatures. Compared to sarcoidosis, MB granulomas feature a structured adaptive immune response, marked by the clustering of plasma cells. Our findings, accessible via https://lab-li.ciim-hannover.de/mb-granuloma/, define key disease signatures, guiding biomarker discovery and therapeutic targeting in granuloma-related diseases.


The codes contains the workflow of cell-type deconvulotion, spatial niches identification and characterization, DEG analysis, and comparative analysis across different granuloma types.
