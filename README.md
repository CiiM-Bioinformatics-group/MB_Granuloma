Spatial transcriptomics reveals immune and tissue remodeling, highlighting diverse host responses across mycobacterial granuloma types
Granulomas are the hallmark of Mycobacterium (MB) infections, forming structured immune environments that drive disease persistence. However, their spatial and functional organization remains unclear. Using spatial RNA sequencing on 39 patient explants, we mapped five distinct granuloma niches: the necrotic core, immune-activated inner niche, inflammatory and Extracellular matrix (ECM)-remodeling middle niche, outer structural niche, and a tertiary lymphoid niche supporting antigen presentation. Immune activity peaks in the inner niche, transitioning to fibrosis at the periphery. Compared to sarcoidosis, MB granulomas feature a structured adaptive immune response, marked by plasma cell clustering. Lymph node granulomas display reduced fibroblast involvement but stronger JAK-STAT activation. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) granulomas exhibit heightened JAK-STAT and IFN-Î³ signaling, while non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) granulomas show increased hypoxia signatures. Our findings, accessible via www.MB-Granuloma-Atlas.org, define key disease signatures, guiding biomarker discovery and therapeutic targeting in granuloma-related diseases.

The codes contains the workflow of cell-type deconvulotion, spatial niches identification and characterization, DEG analysis, and comparative analysis across different granuloma types.
